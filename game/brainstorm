topdown action rpg brainstorms

what ive done so far:

    actor
        -customizable hair, shirt, pants (but only one color)
        -hands with a state machine for holding different types of weapons

To Do:

    armor/clothes
        - armor will go in "slots"
            - head, body, legs, feet, hands, etc
            - changes appearance

    weapons

        - one weapon slot
            - can be 1 or 2 handed, mostly aesthetic

        - types
            
            all weapons have DAMAGE / FIRE_RATE

            - melee
                - will have special visuals: how its held, animation, aiming

            -gun
    
            all guns have MAX_AMMO / CLIP_SIZE / RELOAD_SPEED

                - semi auto gun
                    - one shot per click

                - automatic
                    - holding click fires at full speed
        
                -laser
                    - same as auto, but the bullets will work differently
